# QUESO - A simple expense manager.

![Screenshot](queso-screenshot.png)

## About

Most modern expense managers or budget apps have many great features, but sometimes these long lists of incredible features can make it difficult to use the service. I created Queso to make the process of managing expenses simple for all.

- There is no need to link your bank account.
- There is no need to define your budget.
- Simply add expenses, filter by day, month, or year, and sort by date added or by amount.

The ease of use of queso makes it possible to control your expenses with no learning curve. Most importantly, all your expenses are synced up between all of you devices through you Google account!
